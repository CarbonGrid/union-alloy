In December 2005, Mueller became a part of the Watts Water Technologies, Inc. family of companies. The resources and support that Watts has added to Mueller have enabled the company to consolidate previous efforts while at the same time plan for future growth and expansion in products and services.

Today, Mueller Steam Specialty is the worldâ€™s largest supplier of strainers and the number one provider of specialty products serving the valve industry. While the company has seen many changes, the dedication to quality, service and delivery remains the same. As always, Mueller Steam Specialty brand strainers and valves will continue to be the premier products of their kind in the marketplace.
